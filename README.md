# DataScienceJourney
I'm Danish, a final year student in Bachelor Degree in Computer Science (Computer Network) from Malaysia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ 

# ðŸ¤–About MeðŸ¤–

* ðŸ’»I am a major in Computer Network
* ðŸ“ŠI will undergo my internship at a company that requires me to do tasks on Data Analysis
* ðŸ†•I'm new to Data Analysis, Python, Tableau, SQL and am trying to transition into Data Science


So this is kind a like my journey to self-learn about Data Science. I don't mind shifting job scope as anything can be learn if you really put in the time and hours into it. I would like to secure a full time job after the end of my internship. For that I need to gain as many skills and knowledge I can gain. Wish me the best ðŸ’ª

I started my journey by reading **[Katie Huang's](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Transition-into-Data-Analytics) Github** on how she transition from an Accountant into a Data Engineer. So from her journey I've decided to study the basics of the Data Analysis from Alex's Youtube video on **SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and Python** through his free bootcamp playlist.

As of now I've made progress by learning about the Basic SQL knowledge while following the tutorial as shown by Alex, which includes the Select statement, Where clause, Group By & Order By, Having vs Where and Limit & Aliasing.
